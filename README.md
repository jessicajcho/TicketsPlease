# CS 3110 Final Project : Tickets Please: Alert Level Red
Our team created a game called Tickets, Please: Alert Level Red that is loosely based on the indie game Papers, Please.
Our game vision has not significantly evolved from previous sprints, but each sprint we
have consistently added more features to the game. In Tickets, Please, the player decides
whether or not to let people into a specified location based on given daily rules and
documents that each person provides. Many of these rules change daily, and it is up to the
user to pay attention to who is allowed to enter. The game is (fictionally) narrated by
President Martha Pollack, who tells the player about the daily rules. Our game supports
three documents: a school ID, a vaccine card, and a driverâ€™s license. The player receives
money each time he or she correctly admits or rejects a person, and the player can use this
money to buy items at the end of each day. If a player runs out of money or does not
purchase enough resources to survive, the game ends. Additionally, the player owns several
dogs that may die if the player does not buy them food. The items a player buys may also
give them special abilities for the next day. Additionally, there are special events that are
randomly triggered.
Please see [INSTALL.MD](https://github.com/jessicajcho/PapersPlease/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for instructions to install and play the game.
